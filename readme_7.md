# Experiment-7
# Title: Study of For Loop and While Loop in Python
## Aim:
### To study and implement the use of for loop and while loop in Python programming.
## Theory:
### Looping is a control structure that allows a set of statements to be executed repeatedly based on a condition or over a sequence. Python provides two main types of loops: the for loop and the while loop.
### 1.	For Loop
#### The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence such as a list, tuple, string, or range of numbers. It is generally used when the number of iterations is known in advance.
#### Syntax:
#### for variable in sequence:
####    statements
### The loop variable takes each value from the sequence one by one, and the statements inside the loop are executed for each value.
### Program:
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
### Output:
1
2
3
4
5
### 2.	While Loop
#### The while loop is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly as long as a specified condition remains true. It is generally used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand.
#### Syntax:
#### while condition:
####    statements
#### The condition is checked before every iteration. If the condition becomes false, the loop terminates.
### Program:
#### i = 1

while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
#### Output:
1

#### Difference Between For Loop and While Loop
•	For loop is used when the number of iterations is known.
•	While loop is used when the number of iterations depends on a condition.
•	For loop automatically handles iteration over a sequence.
•	While loop requires manual updating of the loop variable.

## Title: Study of while loop with break, continue, and pass statements in Python
## Aim:
To study and implement the use of break, continue, and pass statements in a while loop in Python.
### Theory:
### The while loop executes a block of statements repeatedly as long as the given condition remains true. The loop control statements break, continue, and pass can alter its normal execution.
### 1.	break statement
The break statement terminates the loop immediately when executed.
### 2.	continue statement
The continue statement skips the remaining statements of the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration.
### 3.	pass statement
The pass statement is used as a placeholder and does not affect the flow of execution.
Program:
i = 1

while i <= 10:

    if i == 3:
        pass

    if i == 5:
        i += 1
        continue

    if i == 8:
        break

    print(i)
    i += 1
Output:

## Title: Study of for loop with break, continue, and pass statements in Python
## Aim:
To study and implement the use of break, continue, and pass statements in a for loop in Python.
## Theory:
### The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence such as a list, string, or range of numbers. Python provides control statements that modify the normal execution of loops.
#### 1.	break statement
The break statement is used to terminate the loop immediately when a specified condition is satisfied. Control transfers to the first statement outside the loop.
#### 2.	continue statement
The continue statement skips the remaining statements in the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.
#### 3.	pass statement
The pass statement is a null statement. It performs no action and is used as a placeholder where a statement is syntactically required.
#### Program:
### for i in range(1, 11):

####    if i == 3:
####        pass

####    if i == 5:
####        continue

####    if i == 8:
####        break

####    print(i)
### Output:
1

### Conclusion :
Thus, the for loop and while loop were studied and implemented successfully using Python programs.
We have also studied Break, Continue and Pass function in for and while loop in Python.
